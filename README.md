# [AlgoViz - Algorithm Visualization App](https://algoviz.yeyintaungnaing.com/)

## Overview
AlgoViz is an interactive web application designed to help users understand sorting, pathfinding, and data structure algorithms through real-time visualizations. The app offers customization options, a discussion forum, and a performance comparison tool, making it a powerful learning resource.

## âœ¨ Inspiration
Was initially inspired by this [Repo](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) by **Clementmihailescu** and decided to do comprehensive visualization web application with additional features.

## Features
### ðŸ“Š Algorithm Visualizer
- Supports various **Sorting algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort).
- Includes **Pathfinding algorithms** (Dijkstra's, A*).
- **Data structure visualization** (Stacks, Queues).
- Adjustable **speed controls** and **array size** selection.
- Inserting own array to test as you like


### ðŸ’¬ Discussion Thread
- **Real-time discussion** section powered by Firebase.
- Users can engage in conversation with other users in discussion section


### âš¡ Performance Comparison
- **Graph-based analysis** to compare runtime complexity.
- **Filters** to analyze different algorithms based on execution speed.
- **Table representation** for detailed insights into performance.


### ðŸ›  Custom Algorithm 
- **"My Algorithm"** feature allowing users to write their own custom sorting algorithm and visualize it immediately on the screen
- Built-in code editor with syntax highlighting.
- Sandboxed execution environment to prevent security issues.
